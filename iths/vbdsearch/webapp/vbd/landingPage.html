


The <strong>Virtual Biospecimen Discovery</strong> (VBD) tool is a searchable database of biospecimens available in
participating NWBT repositories for research.<p/>

The tool provides:
<ul>
    <li>an overview table of the total count of available samples by disease type and specimen type</li>
    <li>the ability to find sets of matched samples (e.g., blood and tumor or normal tissue from the same person)</li>
    <li>the ability to export query result sets</li>
</ul>

Clicking on the sample counts in each cell of the overview table allows users to further filter the dataset by patient
and/or sample characteristics.  The final result set is a table of de-identified data (e.g., histological diagnosis, preservation mode)
for each sample, with accompanying repository contact information for further exploration.<p/>

The final result set may be exported to a spreadsheet for analysis by clicking the “Export” button above the records.
Please contact appropriate repository staff to request samples of interest at this time.<p/>

In addition, a searchable database of biospecimens collected and stored by studies within the FHCRC Public Health
Sciences (PHS) Division is available by clicking <a href="http://www.compass.fhcrc.org/phs/default.aspx" target="blank">here</a>.<p/>
