/**
 * Number of subjects with a Mendelian Violation
 *
 * <p>This annotation uses the likelihoods of the genotype calls to assess whether a site is transmitted from parents to offspring according to Mendelian rules. The output is the likelihood of the site being a Mendelian violation, which can be tentatively interpreted either as an indication of error (in the genotype calls) or as a possible <em><de novo/em> mutation. The higher the output value, the more likely there is to be a Mendelian violation. Note that only positive values indicating likely MVs will be annotated; if the value for a given site is negative (indicating that there is no violation) the annotation is not written to the file.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Caveats</h3>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>The calculation uses a hard cutoff of 10 for the phred scale genotype quality.  If a given sample is below this threshold, the genotype is assumed to be no call.</li>
 *     <li>This annotation requires a valid pedigree file.</li>
 * </ul>
