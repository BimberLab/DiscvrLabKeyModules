/**
 * This interface describes an action that acts upon sequence data.  It is designed to let modules easily register actions that
 * process or visualize data, including those that require background pipeline processing.  If registed, this will appear as an
 * option in the outputfiles dataregion.  When the button is clicked, it will check whether the selected files are available to this
 * handler by calling canProcess().  If the files pass, the handler will do one of two things.  If this handler returns
 * a non-null string for getSuccessUrl(), the window will navigate to this URL.  This would allow the handler to have a secondary page
 * to capture additional user input or show a report.  Alternately,
