## Overview

DISCVR is a collection of extensions to LabKey Server, which is a robust open-source platform designed to manage scientific data with a large and active user base.  The objective of DISCVR is to provide additional features tailored specifically to research labs, beyond what is available through a standard LabKey Server.  

DISCVR originally began as a system to help individual labs manage and utilize the data they create.  This is still a major focus; however, it has grown and now includes a heavy focus on next generation sequencing (see [DISCVR-Seq](https://bimberlab.github.io/DiscvrLabKeyModules/discvr-seq/overview)), along with many other additional features.    

## Documentation
[Please view our documentation](https://bimberlab.github.io/DiscvrLabKeyModules/) for more information about these modules.

## Getting Started

DISCVR requires a working LabKey Server instance.  LabKey's documentation describes [the multiple options available to install and configure LabKey](https://www.labkey.org/Documentation/wiki-page.view?name=config).  They also provide [general documentation on using LabKey Server](https://www.labkey.org/Documentation/wiki-page.view?name=gettingStarted).  The latter is helpful, but not strictly needed for using many DISCVR features.

Too add DISCVR to your LabKey Server, you can either download a full LabKey installer (which includes the core LabKey modules as well), or download a ZIP with just the DISCVR modules. The latter can be unzipped into your server's externalModules or modules directories, similar to [LabKey's documentation on custom modules](https://www.labkey.org/Documentation/wiki-page.view?name=moduleDevelopmentDeployment&_docid=wiki%3A32d7095b-ed56-1034-b734-fe851e088836).  See the [release page for downloads](https://github.com/BimberLab/DiscvrLabKeyModules/releases).

Please [view our documentation for more information](https://bimberlab.github.io/DiscvrLabKeyModules/), or open an issue if you have specific questions.
