## Overview

DISCVR is a collection of extensions to LabKey Server, which is a robust open-source platform designed to manage scientific data with a large and active user base.  The objective of DISCVR is to provide additional features tailored specifically to research labs, beyond what is available through a standard LabKey Server.  
DISCVR originally began as a system designed to help individual labs manage and utilize the data they create.  This is still a major focus; however, it has grown and now includes a heavy focus on next generation sequencing (see [DISCVR-Seq](https://bimberlab.github.io/DiscvrLabKeyModules/discvr-seq/overview)), along with many other additional features.
