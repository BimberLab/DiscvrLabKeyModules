More detail coming soon. Keeping track of reference genomes and their annotations, along with versions of these files is very important for analyses over time. DISCVR-Seq allows you to store/manage reference sequencing, genomic builds (including custom sets of references), and manage annotations (like genes, promoter regions, etc). By managing references centrally, all other aspects of the site, including analysis, visualization (JBrowse) and BLAST automatically will be in sync.
