DISCVR is an extension to LabKey Server. To install and use DISCVR, follow these instructions:

1) You must first download and install LabKey Server. [Click here for instructions and the latest LabKey Server version](https://www.labkey.org/wiki/home/LabKey%20Server%20Documentation/page.view?name=installServerDemo).  

2) Once you have installed LabKey, you need to download the DISCVR modules. You must download the version of DISCVR that matches your LabKey Server's version. For example, if your LabKey Server is version 19.3, you must use the 19.3 version of DISCVR (see links below). Your server version is shown on the LabKey download page, or when running the installer. The links below will let you download the required modules.  Please pay attention to the dependencies and download all required modules.  For example, if you want to use DISCVR-Seq (SequenceAnalysis.module), you will also need to download LDK.module and laboratory.module.  Once downloaded, place these files in the /modules folder of your LabKey Server installation (this will already have many other .module files in it).  On a windows machine it is typically installed in c:\Program Files\LabKey Server. Next, restart your LabKey Server.

Releases of DISCVR and DISCVR-Seq are now pushed to Github.  Please open an issue on the github site if you need a version prior to 19.3.  You can either download a full installed (including core LabKey) or a ZIP with just the DISCVR/DISCVR-Seq modules.
