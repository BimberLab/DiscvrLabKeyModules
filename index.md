##DISCVR / DISCVR-Seq LabKey Modules

DISCVR is a web-based system designed to help individual labs manage and utilize the data they create. It is a series of modules that extend [LabKey Server](https://labkey.org/), a robust open-source platform designed to manage scientific data with a large and active user base. The objective of DISCVR is to provide additional features tailored specifically to research labs, beyond what is available through a standard LabKey Server.
