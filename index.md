DISCVR is a web-based system designed to help individual labs manage and utilize the data they create. It is a series of modules that extend [LabKey Server](https://labkey.org/), a robust open-source platform designed to manage scientific data with a large and active user base. The objective of DISCVR is to provide additional features tailored specifically to research labs, beyond what is available through a standard LabKey Server.  DISCVR is open-source, with the code hosted in the main [Github repository](https://github.com/BimberLab/DiscvrLabKeyModules).
